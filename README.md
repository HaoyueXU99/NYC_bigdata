## BD15: Analysis the Impact of Green Infrastructure on Carbon Monoxide Reduction
This project needs to verify correlations between urban tree plantation and carbon storage by trees and green infrastructures at the city scale. In other words, it should propose a time-series machine learning model to explore the impact of the tree plantation on carbon monoxide reduction. For this, you need to pre-process two separated datasets and remove meaningless and noisy features, and select/combine the meaningful ones. The prepared dataset should contain tree plantation features (e.g., location, for the tree location, health status) and the carbon level data in New York during past years (e.g., 1995-2015). Your time series clustering approach should be optimised to forecast the impact of trees on carbon monoxide with maximum accuracy.
